# Karaoke Frontend Development Checklist

## Project Overview
Building a minimalistic, light-themed karaoke frontend using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components. The app processes MP3 files into separate audio stems (vocals, drums, bass, other) and provides an audio studio interface for playback control.

## Development Checklist

### ✅ Step 1: Project Setup & API Integration
- [x] Set up API service layer with TypeScript interfaces
- [x] Create API client class for backend communication (`/api/process`, `/api/status/{job_id}`, `/api/results/{job_id}`)
- [x] Implement error handling and response type definitions
- [x] Add environment variables for API base URL
- [x] Test API connectivity with health check endpoint

**Key Files**: `lib/api.ts`, `types/api.ts`, `.env.local`

---

### ✅ Step 2: File Upload Interface
- [x] Create upload page with drag-and-drop file input
- [x] Add file validation (MP3, WAV, M4A, FLAC, max 100MB)
- [x] Implement upload progress indicator
- [x] Add visual feedback for file selection and validation errors
- [x] Style with shadcn/ui components (Button, Card, Alert)

**Key Files**: `app/page.tsx`, `components/FileUpload.tsx`

---

### ✅ Step 3: Processing Status & Progress Tracking
- [x] Create progress tracking page/component
- [x] Implement job status polling mechanism
- [x] Display processing stages (stem separation, transcription, beat analysis)
- [x] Add animated progress bars and loading states
- [x] Handle processing errors and retry mechanisms
- [x] Add estimated time remaining display

**Key Files**: `app/processing/[jobId]/page.tsx`, `components/ProcessingStatus.tsx`, `hooks/useJobStatus.ts`

---

### ✅ Step 4: Audio Studio UI Layout
- [x] Design audio studio interface layout (header, waveform area, controls)
- [x] Create individual track components for each stem (vocals, drums, bass, other)
- [x] Implement track control panels (mute/unmute, volume sliders, solo buttons)
- [x] Add master playback controls (play/pause, seek, tempo display)
- [x] Style with video editor-style dark theme interface

**Key Files**: `app/studio/[jobId]/page.tsx`, `components/AudioStudio.tsx`, `components/TrackControl.tsx`

---

### ✅ Step 5: Audio Playback Engine
- [x] Implement synchronized multi-track audio playback
- [x] Create audio context and buffer management system
- [x] Add individual track volume/mute controls
- [x] Implement seek functionality across all tracks
- [x] Handle audio loading states and error recovery
- [x] Add keyboard shortcuts for common controls

**Key Files**: `hooks/useAudioPlayer.ts`, `lib/audioEngine.ts`, `components/AudioControls.tsx`

---

### ✅ Step 6: Waveform Visualization (Optional Enhancement)
- [ ] Add waveform display for audio tracks
- [ ] Implement beat/timing markers from beat analysis
- [ ] Create interactive seek functionality on waveform
- [ ] Style waveforms to match the studio aesthetic
- [ ] Add visual indicators for current playback position

**Key Files**: `components/Waveform.tsx`, `hooks/useWaveform.ts`

---

### ✅ Step 7: Error Handling & User Experience
- [ ] Implement comprehensive error boundaries
- [ ] Add loading states for all async operations
- [ ] Create user-friendly error messages and recovery options
- [ ] Add success notifications and feedback
- [ ] Implement responsive design for mobile/tablet
- [ ] Add tooltips and help text for audio controls

**Key Files**: `components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`, `components/ui/Toast.tsx`, `lib/errorHandling.ts`

---

### ✅ Step 8: Testing & Optimization
- [ ] Test full user flow (upload → processing → studio playback)
- [ ] Optimize audio loading and playback performance
- [ ] Add accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- [ ] Test error scenarios (network failures, invalid files, processing errors)
- [ ] Cross-browser testing for audio playback compatibility
- [ ] Performance optimization and bundle size analysis

**Key Files**: `__tests__/`, `cypress/`, Performance audits

## Technical Architecture

### State Management
- **Job State**: Track current job ID, processing status, and results
- **Audio State**: Manage playback position, track volumes, mute states
- **UI State**: Handle loading states, errors, and user interactions

### Key Features
1. **Multi-step Flow**: Upload → Processing → Studio
2. **Real-time Progress**: Live updates during audio processing
3. **Synchronized Playback**: All audio stems play in perfect sync
4. **Individual Controls**: Mute, volume, and solo for each track
5. **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of network and processing errors

### Audio Requirements
- Synchronized playback of 4 audio files (vocals, drums, bass, other)
- Individual volume and mute controls
- Seek functionality across all tracks
- Master play/pause controls
- BPM and timing information display

## API Integration Points

| Endpoint | Purpose | Implementation |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| `POST /api/process` | Upload MP3 file | File upload component |
| `GET /api/status/{job_id}` | Track progress | Polling hook |
| `GET /api/results/{job_id}` | Get final results | Results fetching |
| `GET /api/files/{job_id}/{filename}` | Download audio files | Audio player URLs |
| `GET /health` | System status | Health check |

---

## Design Guidelines
- **Theme**: Light, minimalistic, professional audio studio aesthetic
- **Colors**: Clean whites, subtle grays, accent colors for interactive elements
- **Typography**: Clear, readable fonts with proper hierarchy
- **Components**: shadcn/ui for consistency and accessibility
- **Icons**: Lucide React for audio controls and interface elements
- **Responsiveness**: Mobile-first approach with desktop optimization
